## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Bootsrap](https://getbootsrap.com/) - CSS framework


### What I learned

Absolute positioning is always tricky. I learned that it is important to be able to position elements absolutely, and to be able to position elements absolutely in a way that is responsive.



```html
<div class="number-section d-flex justify-content-between px-4 border-top ">
```
```css
img {
  border-radius: 100%;
  border: 2px solid #fff;
  position: absolute;
  right: 35%;

}
```




### Continued development

A room to grow in styling elements, and to learn more about the CSS Grid system.
